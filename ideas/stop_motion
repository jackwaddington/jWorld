Automate!

Use pi3a - has hdmi, usb, wifi, camera connection, gpio.

Automation had - to operate a motor to move something slightly every day, and to take a picture of it.

We can control the time of day that the photo is taken, and each time move some thing with a motor. Time of day would be best one hour before sunrise?

We could turn on a light, use the camera, change the position, and be ready to take the picture the next day.

Then compile the current files into a video, that could output to a TV.
