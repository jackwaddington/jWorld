# eWorld
This is a world, there are many like it - but this is my world.

The purpose is to build a world where computers are talking to each other - recording, sharing and expressing data.

I take some influence from Apple eWorld, that I used as a child. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EWorld

I must acknoweldge that I am a victim to Raspbery Pis marketing department and I find them very cute and collectable. I will put my collection to work!

In a world, we need services. Here we have electricity and network.

Electricity is provided from mains power with USB power leads.

The Network is handed by a Raspbery Pi 4 1gb running OpenBSD. It can be connected to an external network and provides wired connectivity for other devices through a USB ethernet dongle connected to an ethernet switch and WiFi for the wireless devices through on board WiFi.

On the ethernet we have:

- R Pi 4 2gb running a database.
- R Pi 3 running??
- R Pi 5 as a desktop computer.

On Wifi we have;

- Pi Zero W with camera
